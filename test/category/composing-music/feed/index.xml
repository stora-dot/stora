										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This project&#8217;s goal is to create two studies using at least three untuned percussion instruments. Despite the fact that I could have used some of the examples provided as a starting point for my work, I chose to build them from scratch.</p>



<p>While I thought using more instruments would be easier, the variety of instruments available and the techniques for each instrument were overwhelming. I often worked on a single instrument and then realized it didn&#8217;t fit well with the others, forcing me to rewrite it. That took longer than I anticipated.</p>



<p>A characteristic that I noticed about some of the percussion compositions I listened to is that they are coupled with dance or body movements. Therefore, the central focus of both of my studies is on expressive dance and bodily movement.</p>



<h2 id="study-1">Study 1</h2>



<p>My professional background is in advertising, and as I started thinking about this first research, I remembered an old Lacoste commercial called The Leap. This video shows a couple sitting at a coffee table, with the boy preparing to kiss the girl for the first time. The film then turns to a metaphor for what&#8217;s going on inside his head: a massive leap into the unknown. I immediately thought of my <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/project-1-percussion-solos" target="_blank">first study of Taiko</a> and how it is linked to breathing rhythm. Due to this, I chose the video and the Taiko as the basis for my initial study.</p>



<p>I decided Taiko was the foundation of this composition, the heart, and then I added instruments that I thought might be able to bring the breath rhythm to life. Wood Blocks first function as an echo of the heart (Taiko) and then as the rush of the mind. The snare brings a marching strength that reminds me of running. The tam-tam is used as a reminder of the character&#8217;s great action&#8217;s danger. Cabasas are merely used to cause confusion and dizziness.</p>



<p>When I was looking for information on instrument techniques, I came upon <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/instruments/percussion/" target="_blank">Philharmonia&#8217;s excellent webpage</a> on percussion instruments. There, I examined the tam-tam and one unique technique in which the musician rubs a triangular stick against the tam-tam&#8217;s edge&nbsp;to produce a harsh sound. If the player rubbed it gently enough, it could simulate the sound of the wind.</p>



<p>There are three parts to this piece:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The acceleration of breathing</li><li>The suspension of jumping</li><li>The unpredictability of the first kiss</li></ul>



<p>As much as possible, I tried to make it concise and interesting while staying true to the main idea. My 3rd section used a time change from 5/4 to 3/4 in order to help create some confusion. The ending was inspired by my first <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/06/listening-to-arthur-honegger-cello-sonata-h-20-iii-presto" target="_blank">listening of Honegger</a>, with the ending feeling incomplete (just like every first kiss, you want more from the moment) in a 4/4 bar rather than a 5/4 bar.</p>

<h2 id="study-2">Study 2</h2>



<p>This study was inspired by flamenco dances I watched as a kid. There were times when a male and female dancer alternated. The idea behind this song is to create a classic storyline in which a girl meets a boy and in the end, they dance together.</p>



<p>I have divided this piece into three parts:</p>



<ul class="is-style-cnvs-list-styled"><li>The girl is introduced</li><li>The boy is introduced</li><li>They both dance together</li></ul>



<p>I attempted to use some Latin instruments, but because some of them were unfamiliar to me, I had to do some additional research into their techniques.</p>



<p>The Cajon and Tambourine offer the rhythm&#8217;s foundation. I looked at Vic Firth&#8217;s tutorials for the tambourine, particularly the usage of the thumb roll as a gentle and long roll that could fit this rhythm. Because I couldn&#8217;t find a standardized method to notate the Cajon, I created a two-line stave with the low strokes on the bottom line and the high strokes on the top line.</p>



<p>The girl is represented by the Castanets and the Guiro. For me, the Guiro was a whole new instrument. After seeing and listening to Guiro rhythms, I decided to keep it basic and only provide some context for the Castanets.</p>



<p>Bongos and Claves symbolize the boy. Cajon&#8217;s low pitch led me to choose Bongos instead of Congas since they are higher pitched. It is written in two-line Bongo notation.</p>

		<span>Variations, rhythm and all that jazz.</span>

</h2>



<p>I listened to all 16 variations from Boris Blacher&#8217;s Variations On A Paganini Theme, but I was curious how it sounded and looked in a concert, so I watched a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>The Paganini Caprice theme fades away after a few seconds, and Blacher&#8217;s variants come to life on their own. There&#8217;s a little resemblance to it now and then, but it&#8217;s really subtle. Another thing I noticed is that Blacher strives to showcase all instruments through the variations, starting with strings, then on to woodwinds, and finally to brass. Percussion continues to come and go as the variants change. Despite the fact that I believe most of the variants to be quite vibrant rhythmically, there is no variation dedicated only to percussion.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a score, and despite the fact that different time signatures were used between variations, I couldn&#8217;t figure out if Variable Metre was used at all.</p>



<p>For me, the second&nbsp;and last two&nbsp;variations were the most intriguing. The second variation features a bluesy oboe with blue notes, which I adore (and it looks like the player from the performance I posted does too). The 15th and 16th have a jazzier flavour to them, and they remind me of big bands. That was a fantastic conclusion. &#8220;Dominant rhythm and abrupt ends are Blacher hallmarks,&#8221; (Simon, 2003) I realized after learning more about Blacher.</p>



<p>All of this jazz influence, and how he changed it into an orchestral sound, piqued my curiosity in Blacher, and I&#8217;m likely to listen to him more in the future, and perhaps include some of his influences into my works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Side Note about Variations. I had no clue what variations were, let alone how popular Paganini&#8217;s theme was. Basically, variation form is when you take a song&#8217;s theme and investigate, mine, twist, and transform it into a new piece of art (Hough, 2013). It appears to me to be a creative exercise rather than the construction of completely new work. I enjoy the idea of variations, and I&#8217;m curious as to why there aren&#8217;t any big musicians that do variations of other artists&#8217; songs. This reminds me that some DJs are experimenting with several versions of the same song like Stereossauro did with Carlos Paredes&#8217; Verdes Anos.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Composing for two instruments should have been easy for me, but it turned out to be more difficult. Beyond the obvious snare and bass drum, I had a hard time deciding which instruments should make a duet. Then I had difficulties getting it to function beyond the basic concept; I constantly felt like one instrument was missing.</p>



<p>The purpose of this project is to write four short compositions with at least eight bars each for two untuned instruments. The conversation between the instruments should be explored in the first two parts. The latter two should experiment with unusual time signatures &#8211; five and seven beats per bar, respectively.</p>



<h2 id="snare-drum-bass-drum">Snare Drum &amp; Bass Drum</h2>



<p>For the first study, I chose the one that was most comfortable for me. I&#8217;m familiar with the snare and bass drum&#8217;s characteristics, so I sought to create a piece that would explore a dialogue between the two. The goal is for each participant to &#8220;talk&#8221; in turn until they are both in unison. The second section of this composition was inspired by a scene from Carmen Suite (that I reviewed <a href="https://pedrovintem.000webhostapp.com/2021/07/listening-to-rodion-shchedrin-carmen-suite" target="_blank">here</a>), in which the Marimba and Vibrafono had a little dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="shaker-wood-block">Shaker &amp; Wood Block</h2>



<p>In this work, I had a concept of a conversation, but it&#8217;s one of those where one side does the majority of the talking while the other simply attempts to say something but finds it nearly impossible and eventually becomes frustrated. If I&#8217;m being frank, I think the shaker can be irritating if used frequently. I discovered George Crumb&#8217;s Music For a Summer Evening when researching the shaker. The use of the shaker piqued my interest, and it led me to conclude the conversation in bar 7.</p>

<h2 id="castanets-tambourine">Castanets &amp; Tambourine</h2>



<p>When I was listening to Carmen Suite, I noticed how the castanets were used to create a more danceable rhythm. I looked into what approaches could be used in the castanets for my third composition, but in the end, the flamenco dancers who hit their shoes on the floor to mark the rhythm inspired me more.</p>

<h2 id="triangle-cymbal">Triangle &amp; Cymbal</h2>



<p>With the last one, I wanted to go darker. In my perspective, the cymbal has either a massive marking when struck hard or a mystery marking when slammed softly. After seeing Vic Firth&#8217;s video with the suspended cymbal, I decided to use the Marimba Mallet&#8217;s deeper tone. However, because it is preferable to describe the desired sound rather than the mallet (Solomon, 2002), I put &#8220;dark.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s amusing that a quick Google search for [Variable Metre Boris Blacher] yields nearly exclusively results from OCA students&#8217; blogs. Are we the only ones who have written on Variable Metre?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to provide an entire biography of Boris Blacher here (an excellent summary can be found in Simon, 2003), but I did discover that he studied architecture before becoming a renowned composer. Probably that is why he developed the Variable Metre, which is made up of &#8220;patterns, certainly, but used as expressive building blocks&#8221; (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24).</p>



<p>But first, let&#8217;s look at the formal definition of Variable Metre from The Oxford Dictionary of Music:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">[a rhythmical process] whereby systematic changes of metre are planned according to mathematical relationships.</p><cite>(Kennedy, Kennedy and Rutherford-Johnson, 2013)</cite></blockquote>



<p>I believe that it is simpler to say that Variable Metre is when a piece of music with a continual shift in time signature based on a numeric pattern. This pattern can have a mathematical relationship, but I don&#8217;t believe it is always true. It&#8217;s also easier to understand if you look at it:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1fZQ6vsTcWMsSif1J3uHEMJGXZ2JLKa2I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Numbers below the tempo marker indicate the time signature, while dots indicate incremental changes to the next value.</p>



<p>Although some sources claim he did not invent Variable Metre (Quinn, 2005), he was most likely the one who developed it most.</p>



<p>I must admit that when I initially read the definition of Variable Metre, I was sceptical about whether or not I would enjoy hearing it. I agreed with critics who claimed that this method was more like eye-music than ear-music (Matthew-Walker 2003, p.24). My opinion changed when I heard his Piano Concerto No.2.</p>

<p>After hearing it multiple times and assessing which sections I loved the most and which parts I didn&#8217;t believe Variable Metre made a significant difference, I realized that this technique works best when the notes are&nbsp;repeated. In Konzert für Klavier und Orchester, No. 2: I. Allegro, this happens. You&#8217;re listening to the same thing over and over, but each time the time changes, a new puzzle piece is added. As if a block is being added to a building to make it more stunning. This enables the creation of anticipation and disruption. I believe these two qualities are&nbsp;appealing to the ear.</p>



<p>In conclusion, I believe it was worthwhile to learn about Variable Metre, but I find it difficult to think of it as anything more than a creative exercise if it is not utilized with repetition.</p>

</h2>



<p>When I was researching the tambourine, I came across Rodion Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen Suite for string orchestra and percussion (1967). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>A little backstory. When Shchedrin&#8217;s wife, Maya Plisetskaya, asked Shostakovich to write a new Carmen ballet, he &#8220;gently but firmly refused.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Bizet.&#8221; After that, she asked her husband, who agreed. Shostakovich&#8217;s response demonstrates Shchedrin&#8217;s bravery. After its debut performance, the Carmen Suite was deemed &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; to Bizet&#8217;s opera and was banned by the Soviet leadership. (Plisetskaya, 2001)</p>



<p>I feel that percussion, such as tubular bells, cymbals and castanets, are used throughout Shchedrin&#8217;s score to emphasize rhythms. Although he pays homage to the original material, he frequently pushes the music in unexpected ways, heightening the atmosphere and drama.</p>



<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;side,&nbsp;I&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;presence&nbsp;of&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather&nbsp;comic&nbsp;at&nbsp;times, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;timpani&nbsp;glissando&nbsp;is&nbsp;used&nbsp;or&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;strings&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;effects. </p>



<p>Overall, I think the experiment of using percussion to replace other instruments was a great success, and the end result was quite entertaining. If it&#8217;s superior to the original? I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to respond.</p>



<p>It reminded me of Johnny Cash&#8217;s Hurt version. It was a risky move for producer Rick Rubin to persuade Johnny Cash to record a version of Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s Hurt. Cash refused to sing the song, which was widely regarded as one of NIN&#8217;s best. It wasn&#8217;t until he read the lyrics that Cash realized he could make his own version of the song. Finally, the singer and producer managed to create a masterpiece from a masterpiece. It wasn&#8217;t better or worse than the original; rather, it was unique. Instead of being a song about drugs and self-destruction, they transformed it into an acoustic song about the epilogue of an eventful life.</p>

<p>Like NIN/Cash&#8217;s Hurt, Bizet/Shchedrin&#8217;s Carmen can exist in the music world indefinitely as two different but interconnected works that don&#8217;t have to be judged against each other.</p>

		<span>I have never composed for percussion before</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>Composing exclusively for percussion is something new for me. In fact, composing in notation is also a first for me. Usually, I just sit at the piano and compose. I believe that creating in this way took me longer, but that time allowed me to go deeper into the instruments and better understand what I could do with them.</p>



<p>The lack of a standard for notating percussion instruments was the first hurdle I faced (Black and Gerou, 2005). As a result, to have a consistent notation, I used the Essential Dictionary of Orchestration. Also, because some percussion instruments have little or no natural resonance, I chose to change the note-length in order to have fewer rests, which keeps the piece from becoming cluttered and difficult to read (Solomon, 2002). </p>



<p>The&nbsp;goal&nbsp;for&nbsp;this&nbsp;project&nbsp;was&nbsp;to&nbsp;compose&nbsp;four&nbsp;short&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;for&nbsp;untuned&nbsp;instruments&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;choice. I chose the Triangle, the Snare Drum, the Taiko and the Tambourine.</p>



<h2 id="the-triangle" class="has-huge-font-size">The Triangle</h2>



<p>Because this is my first time composing for percussion, I chose to work with the triangle. Eric Hopes wrote it best when he said: &#8220;The truth is that anyone can play the triangle. It is one of the most basic musical instruments.&#8221; (How to Be a Professional Triangle Player | Musicians of the Utah Symphony, n.d.). To test it out, I started writing in a simple time signature, and it sounded good. A section of this work was influenced by Antonín Dvořák&#8217;s Symphony No. 9 in E minor (3rd movement), of which I discovered a performance of the triangle on Youtube.</p>

<h2 id="the-snare-drum" class="has-huge-font-size">The Snare Drum</h2>



<p>For me, the snare drum was an obvious option because it is the percussion instrument with which I am most familiar. Chop Suey! by System Of A Down began playing on my Spotify while I was composing this piece. I interpreted it as both a divine sign and a challenge. Could this song&#8217;s verse serve as inspiration for a snare solo? Yes, I believe so.</p>

<h2 id="the-taiko" class="has-huge-font-size">The Taiko</h2>



<p>Because I knew nothing about this instrument, I did some research and discovered the principle of &#8220;breath rhythm,&#8221; in which a piece&#8217;s metrical markers are sensed and played as the rhythm of breath (Powell, 2012). This inspired me to set the tempo to 64 because an adult breath rhythm is around 16 breaths per minute, multiplied by four equals 64. This piece, I believe, can translate your breathing before doing something exciting, such as fighting in a war or kissing someone for the first time. Your breathing quickens, you hold your breath for a brief moment, and then it&#8217;s all adrenaline.</p>

<p>For me, this was not an obvious choice. I&#8217;d never given the tambourine much thought before, but when I was looking for instruments, I came across Edoardo Giachino&#8217;s video of him playing it and was inspired to use it in this project.</p>

<p>What I like about the tambourine is that it reminds me of Spanish/Latin sounds that I&#8217;m familiar with. Particularly in Bizet&#8217;s Carmen, which I may review later in my listening log. I attempted to create some fanfare in this piece. Fanfares are typically performed for brass or brass and percussion instruments (Florek, 2015), so I figured why not a tambourine fanfare?</p>

		<span>Thinking about percussion led me to a revolution.</span>
	</span>
</h2>



<p>I remember going to a football stadium for the first time when I was six years old to see a game at the Sport Lisboa and Benfica stadium. A large concrete stadium with a capacity of roughly 120.000 spectators. The score was 0-0 at halftime, and the fans were growing concerned. Then something happened that I had never experienced before. The concrete benches began to shake, a rumbling sound grew louder, and it felt like an earthquake. It was the supporters&#8217; feet that stomped on the ground. Thousands of people making a rhythmic sound altogether. It was frightening, powerful and incredible. It was my first experience with live percussion. Benfica won by 3-0.</p>



<p>Beginning my music degree with a study of rhythm and percussion prompted me to look into the history of percussion instruments and their role in music. I ended up viewing Steven Schick&#8217;s presentation. </p>

<p>The presentation was entertaining and light while yet being instructive. One thing he said remained with me out of all the things he mentioned. His definition of percussion instruments.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>&#8220;[Percussion instruments] are simple objects that make sound by striking them.&#8221;</p><cite>University of California Television (UCTV), 2013.&nbsp;<em>On the Bridge: The Beginnings of Contemporary Percussion Music with Steven Schick &#8212; To Be Musical</em>.  Available at: &lt;http://University/ of California Television (UCTV)&gt; [Accessed 17 June 2021].</cite></blockquote>



<p>It&#8217;s really that simple. It&#8217;s so simple that I believe anyone, regardless of musical knowledge, can play a percussion instrument. And I believe that is why percussion is at the very beginning of this course. It&#8217;s simple, doable and fun. And yet it&#8217;s so powerful.</p>



<p>Steven Schick also mentions a quote by John Cage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Percussion music is revolution.&#8221;</p><cite>Cage, J., 1973.&nbsp;<em>Silence</em>. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, p.87.</cite></blockquote>



<p>John Cage, I believe, meant that percussion allowed musicians to break away from the constraints imposed by classical composers who used the same sounds. Percussion provided an opportunity for exploration. Anything that generated a sound when struck may be included in the music. And the terms &#8220;percussion&#8221; and &#8220;revolution&#8221; immediately brought José Afonso&#8217;s Grândola Vila Morena to mind. Since it was utilized as the start of the Portuguese revolution, this is one of the most emblematic Portuguese songs. Only voice and the sound of marching feet on gravel can be heard during the entire song. And it caused a revolution, politically and musically speaking. For me, that was because of percussion. Isn&#8217;t it percussion if you hit the gravel with your feet? It makes sound by striking them, right?</p>
